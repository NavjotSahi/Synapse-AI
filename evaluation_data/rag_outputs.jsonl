ANSWER: "A symbol table is a data structure used in compilers to store information about program variables that is required during compilation.  This information includes the class of variable (keyword, identifier, etc.), type (integer, float, array, function, etc.), storage amount required, memory address, and scope information.  The symbol table is accessed by compiler phases whenever this information is needed."

ANSWER: "Anomaly detection in the banking sector classifies data objects into two groups: normal distribution and outliers.  This helps expose suspicious transactions.  Machine learning techniques, such as those used in fraud detection, can restrict account activities based on authentication and validation.  Efficient resource management, improved operational performance, and smart decision-making are advantages of using machine learning technologies for anomaly detection in banking and finance.  Fraud detection is a key use case of machine learning in the banking sector."

ANSWER: "Algorithmic trading enables profit production at a very high intensity, which is difficult for individual buyers.  Complex formulas, mathematical models, and human inaccuracy are used by algorithmic models to sell or buy financial securities.  High-frequency algorithmic trading technology allows for 10,000 trades in a fraction of time.  AI is used in algorithmic trading through ML-based validation mechanisms bridging the security and functional gap between front-end trades and back-end operations.

ANSWER: "Model-based collaborative filtering avoids overfitting and is scalable, improving prediction performance.  However, it's inflexible, making it hard to add information for users who don't rate, and suffers from sparsity problems because it can't generate reasonable recommendations for all users.  The provided text does not describe the specifics of memory-based collaborative filtering beyond stating it is a type of collaborative filtering."
